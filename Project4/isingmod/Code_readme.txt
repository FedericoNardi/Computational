The code is divided into two files:
- main.cpp: contains the main functions
- ising.cpp: contains all the functions called in main

Set initial parameters in the first lines of "main.h"
Comment/uncomment printing statement depending on whether you want to get data after very MC cycle or after the number of cycles in the variable "MCcycles" (for example when running through the temperature interval comment the statement in "ising.cpp" and uncomment the one in "main.cpp")
